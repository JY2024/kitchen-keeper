## Introduction

Kitchen Keeper is a website that helps users keep track of the contents of their fridge and discover ways to use their ingredients to make food. The purpose of the application is to make it easier for people to use what they already have in their kitchen to make delicious foods. The website includes:
1. A main page where users can enter food into their "fridge," see all the foods they have by category (fruit, veggies, etc), and view a pie chart showing the distribution of their food.
2. A social page where users can view recipes made by other users, search for recipes, see popular tags, and make their own posts.
3. A meal generation page where users can select ingredients from their fridge and receive AI-generated recipes.

Kitchen Keeper was made using React, Django, and OpenAI API.
