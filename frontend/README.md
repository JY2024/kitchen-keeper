# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Start React server in development mode

You can run the following commands to run the React server in development mode:
1. In your terminal, `console cd` into the frontend directory from the `kitchen-keeper` route directory:
    - `cd frontend`

2. In the `frontend` directory, enter the following command to run the `console npm run dev` script from the `package.json` file:
    - `npm run dev`'

To start the Django backend server that is connected to a PostgreSQL database hosted on ElephantSQL (PostgreSQL as a service), view the README.md file in the Django backend project directory.
